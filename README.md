# Apache Thrift Specs

There is an *Apache Thrift Missing Manual* project already, but as someone trying to develop a new language implementation from scratch there is a real lack of documentation around the actual specification of protocols for example. Most of the time the answer to *how does this work?* is to look at an existing implementation, which is like a game of telephone for replicating issues in specific implementations.

So, these are useful to me, maybe to someone else as well.
